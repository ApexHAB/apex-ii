# Apex II High Altitude Balloon

Version II of the high altitude weather balloon launched by Sutton Grammar School.  

The project aims to follow in the steps of Apex I after its unfortunate loss and take reasonable quality images of the Earth from near-space. We also aim to test transmission on baud rates and line codes different from the normal 50 baud RTTY.  

We have an additional payload of two Geiger-Muller tubes to measure ionising radiation in the atmosphere.
